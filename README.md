# weather-forecast-app

Hello there! This is a simple weather forecast application that allows you to get any city's weather situation by simply entering the city name inside of the input.
The data comes from the https://openweathermap.org/. Please don't forget to use your own api key. To be able to get the api key for yourself, you just need to register to 
openweathermap.org. After the registration, go to the My API keys page and generate one for yourself! After that, put it inside of the code and there you go! Have fun :)!
